                        The ultimate goal of the Library is to make all the published works of humankind available
                        to everyone in the world. While large in scope and ambition, this goal is within our grasp.
                        Achieving it will require the participation of librarians, authors,
                        government officials and technologists.
                        Imagine what a comprehensive, open library could be! A talented math whiz who lives in a rural
                        community can explore the works of high math. An elderly person can have a large print edition
                        of any book ever published. An innovative young scholar can publish a book directly to this great
                        library on subjects that might not otherwise make it through the long and difficult publication process.
                        Our hope is that libraries and individual book readers will join this project and together
                        we can build towards universal access to all knowledge.
